# Salesforce Constant Contact Integration

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Access Token Notice
‚ùó This project was built using a free Constant Contact developer account, which has since expired.
The current API Key and Access Token are no longer valid, and API calls will fail until new credentials are provided.

‚úÖ Business Logic Verified

The integration logic‚Äîincluding token management, API callouts, and record synchronization‚Äîhas been thoroughly tested and functions as expected. Only the credentials have expired.

## üîß How to Use This Integration
To get this integration working again with your own Constant Contact account:
	1. Create a Constant Contact Developer Account üëâ Visit developer.constantcontact.com and sign up.
	2. Register an App to Get Credentials
	3. Generate a new API Key
	4. Complete the OAuth 2.0 flow to obtain a valid Access Token
	5. Update Salesforce Configuration
	6. Replace the old API Key and Token in your Named Credential
	7. Update any relevant Custom Metadata Types or Custom Settings as needed
	8. Confirm Token Refresh Logic

## Summary
This Salesforce integration enables seamless data flow between Salesforce and Constant Contact via RESTful API, allowing for automated event and event registration management. With this solution, users can synchronize event lists and registrant information directly from Salesforce to Constant Contact, maintaining an active connection. Automated token management ensures uninterrupted data updates.

## Features
* **Automated Token Management**: Refreshes access tokens every 24 hours to ensure continuous connectivity.
* **Event List Synchronization**: Automatically creates Constant Contact event lists based on Salesforce event data.
* **Registrant Management**: Adds and updates event registrants as contacts within Constant Contact, directly from Salesforce.
* **API Request Handling**: Implements secure OAuth 2.0 token handling, with dynamic refresh capability using Named Credentials.
